I am not a very physically active person. That reflects prominently that I don't like outdoor games much. Most of my games are PC based video games. I don't own a gaming console. I don't time shooter games and more into fantasy/magic or strategy games.

* Dota 2
* Warcraft III
* Carrom
* Monument Valley
* God is a Cube
* Baba Is You
* Age of Mythology
* Age of Empires

The one game that I am perpetually in a beginner stage learner is Chess. I want to master it but never dedicating enough time to play it more.
