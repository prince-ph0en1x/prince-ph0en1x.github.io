I started my musical journey very early, around the age of 3. As a kid, I used to like listening to music. My dad took me to a cassette store and I chose a flute recital of [Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hariprasad_Chaurasia) as a present for myself. That was the beginning as I recall.
A few days months later, after much struggle, my parents were able to find a home tutor for me who would teach me Bengali Vocal. Jayanta Sir, took up that difficult task to train a 3 year extremely fidgety kid, who could barely reach his arms across to the bellow of the [Harmonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_organ#Harmonium). 
I started out with some basic vocal trainings, eventually learning, like any stereotypical Bengali kid, Rabindrasangeet. As Sir and my parents soon realised, I always focused more on playing the instrument than my singing. Music and the rhythm was more important for me. Thereon, I started liking more Nazrulgeeti, which are typically more fast paced.
Sir used to accompany me with the table, while I sung while playing the harmonium. I learnt some basic Indian classical ragas and to recognise taals.

When I shifted from Purulia to Kolkata, everything changed. This was no exception. I took tution under .. . This is when I came in contact with his son, Shyamal da, who accompanied me with the tabla. He quickly became my friend, philosopher and guide. From watching music videos together to trying out experimental beats.
I passed the first two levels of Indian classical exam under the Allahabad gharana. While I was mostly learning Nazrulgeeti, sir was very inclined to teach me hymns of Kali and Krishna. This never grew on me. I was rather moving towards Bengali modern music (Adhunik), or Nachiketa, Indranil, Shyamal Mitra, etc.




I briefly learnt [Santoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santoor) from [Chiradip Sarkar](https://www.youtube.com/user/dipsantoor/) during few college vacations. He is a dear student of [Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarun_Bhattacharya), who inturn was a student of [Pandit Ravi Shankar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar).
<br>
(from Wiki) The Indian santoor instrument is a trapezoid-shaped hammered dulcimer, and a variation of the Iranian Santur. The instrument is generally made of walnut and has 25 bridges. Each bridge has 4 strings, making for a total of 100 strings. It is a traditional instrument in Jammu and Kashmir, and dates back to ancient times. It was called Shatha Tantri Veena in ancient Sanskrit texts.
