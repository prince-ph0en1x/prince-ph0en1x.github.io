### Quantifying it

Recently I was reading this article on [contructing space-time from computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06987) which opened the flood gates of correlating theories in my head.

Before I describe my proposition, let's list down the ingredients:
* [Plancherel's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plancherel_theorem) which states the integral of a function's squared modulus is equal to the integral of the squared modulus of its frequency spectrum.
* Kolmogorov/Algorithmic complexity
* String length
* Launderer's principle
* Fourier transform
* It from Bit
* Thermodynamics
* Measurement in Quantum Mechanics

The equation:

$$ \biggl\Vert \int_0^{t_u} |f(x)|^2dx - \int_{-\infty}^\infty|f(\xi)|^2d\xi \biggl\Vert \equiv \bigl(len(S) - K_\mathcal{U}(S|X)\bigl)kTln2 $$

The interpretation:

Let $f(x)$ be the state of the Universe encoded as a bit string. The absolute difference between the integral of the function's squared modulus and the integral of the squared modulus of its frequency spectrum gives us the amount of new information generated by the Universe in the time duration of the integral of the function, i.e. $[0,t_u]$. This is equivalent to the work value of the bit string given by the fuel value of the string scaled by the Boltzman constant and the temperature, following reversed Launderer's principle. The fuel value is the difference between the length of the string and the conditional Kolmogorov complexity of the bit string, given the Fourier transform of it. This transform represents the derivable physical laws given the bit pattern of the Universe.
