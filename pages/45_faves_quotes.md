To be formatted:
* One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it. (Kung Fu Panda)
* When it was over, all I could think about was how this entire notion of oneself, what we are, is just this logical structure, a place to momentarily house all the abstractions. It was a time to become conscious, to give form and coherence to the mystery, and I had been a part of that. It was a gift. Life was raging all around me and every moment was magical. I loved all the people, dealing with all the contradictory impulses - that's what I loved the most, connecting with the people. Looking back, that's all that really mattered. (Waking Life)
* Power is a curious thing, my lord… Power resides where men believe it resides. It’s a trick, a shadow on the wall. And, a very small man can cast a very large shadow
* Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you
* A mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone
* God answers all prayers, but sometimes his answer is 'no'. (Angels & Demons)
* Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves.
* One does not need to have cancer to analyze its symptoms.
* Men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to obtain what they desire. (― Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code)
