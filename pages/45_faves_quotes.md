* "Mistakes" is the word you're too embarrassed to use. You ought not to be. You're a product of a trillion of them. Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool: the mistake. (Westworld)
* The observer is the observed and therein lies sanity, the whole, and with the holy is love. (Jiddu Krishnamurti)
* Choices ... We cannot go back. That's why it's hard to choose. You have to make the right choice. As long as you don't choose, everything remains possible. (Mr. Nobody)
* Every path is the right path. Everything could've been anything else. And it would have just as much meaning. (Mr. Nobody)
