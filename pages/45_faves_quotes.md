* "Mistakes" is the word you're too embarrassed to use. You ought not to be. You're a product of a trillion of them. Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool: the mistake. (Westworld)
* The observer is the observed and therein lies sanity, the whole, and with the holy is love. (Jiddu Krishnamurti)
* Choices ... We cannot go back. That's why it's hard to choose. You have to make the right choice. As long as you don't choose, everything remains possible. (Mr. Nobody)
* Every path is the right path. Everything could've been anything else. And it would have just as much meaning. (Mr. Nobody)
* You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There is a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present. (Kung Fu Panda)
* One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it. (Kung Fu Panda)
* When it was over, all I could think about was how this entire notion of oneself, what we are, is just this logical structure, a place to momentarily house all the abstractions. It was a time to become conscious, to give form and coherence to the mystery, and I had been a part of that. It was a gift. Life was raging all around me and every moment was magical. I loved all the people, dealing with all the contradictory impulses - that's what I loved the most, connecting with the people. Looking back, that's all that really mattered. (Waking Life)

* A mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone
* God answers all prayers, but sometimes his answer is 'no'. (Angels & Demons)
* Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves.
* Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed.
* One does not need to have cancer to analyze its symptoms.
* Men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to obtain what they desire. (― Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code)
* History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books-books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As Napoleon once said, 'What is history, but a fable agreed upon?
* Faith ― acceptance of which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove.
*
