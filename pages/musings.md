## Down the rabbit hole...
Can you stop thinking? Can you stop thinking about thinking? ... there you go... down the portal again... exploring the unknown unknowns...

## Quotes

A collection of those eureka moments when you find an allegory worth remembering – while reading a book, brooding in the shower, or deep philosophical conversations with friends.
* Be it described by, Low-complexity art or Occam's razor; Nature favors designs with high informational entropy with low Kolmogorov complexity... in short, God is a lazy programmer!
* "Sarcasm is a word in the lexicon"... is a self-referential statement. It is either false, or true but cannot be proven in the premise while preserving it sarcastic truth at the same instant! Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.
* All of learning theory is mostly "Classification + Correlation"... dividing data into sets and understanding the relations between them.
* Pressing UnDo does not take you into the past, it takes you to an alternate future. Pressing ReDo does not correct your mistake, it accounts for a misjudgment requiring two actions.

## My 'dharma'

I really like the Socrates way of a conversation or debate. So let me present what I believe in via these dialogues

### God and Mayonnaise

T: What are your views about god?

A: I don't think god is necessary. Yes, organised religion was necessary to guide people to morality. But in the current era of 
science; god is an added burden, a deviation from Occam's razor.

T: I would argue that god is Occam's razor. Believing in an omnipotent god resolves all problems. But, let's keep that aside for a 
while and assume that god is not necessary. But so is mayonnaise. But mayonnaise exists. There are no many things that you do not 
believe is necessary, or do not even know that it exist - but in reality, they do exist. How does that change the reality of its 
existance.

A: Yes, I do not know that mayonnaise brand americans use; that does not refute its existance. But, it is possible to totally live 
without mayonnaise. Removing mayonnaise from the equation of human civilization will not threaten the existence of the universe.

T: Some mayo based dishes would fail to exist then. But the non-existance of mayo to you does not mean it doesn't exist.

A: Yes. So mayo is known by more people, validating its existance. That is what give mayo its existance.

T: Atleast 1 person in the World believes that god exist. Does that mean there is god.

A: No. A mojority believing in something, or an individual believeing in something does not make it real. The difference between 
mayo is it can be sensed, experimented and physically tangibly manipulated by other human beings in the same way.

T: So is it with god. Theists agree how they experience god.

A: But so are dreams. That brings us to the dream agruement. Both mayo and god generates electrical signals in the neurons. Both 
dream and reality does. Why is one more real and another is fiction. Dreams are real in my arguement. Dreams are fragments of real 
thought caused by neural impulsed. They are as real as thinking of the notion of a god. Both creates realisitic signals. But just 
as we agree on dreams being just thoughts and not occuring in the physical world, so are divine miracles.

T: How do you distinguish that the mayo taste is physical while the dream of mayo is not?

A: Sensor fusion? In dreams, the starting sensor data is missing. We dont remeber the exact sight, smell or taste; we directly 
experience the mayo. In the reality, the low level sensor data is also accessable. It's not always black or white - under the 
effect of alcohol sometimes feels like dreamy, because we start to lose reception of the sensor data.

T: So is the feelings like loneliness, boredom, fear, also fake

A: No they are not. They are supported by idle sensor organs, or physical activities, etc.

T: So is god. God is one level meta. Existance of abstract feelings like fear, awe, happiness gives rise to god.

A: I don't mind accepting god as a meta-emotion. But as long as it stays in the category of emotion. Its meta property does not 
allow it to travel to the real World. It can however influence our emotion, just like emotions affect our actions. E.g. holy wars.

T: Holy wars are organised religion. We are talking about a personal god.

A: Then, as long as we do not believe praying will have a tangible effect.

T: Praying does help us attain peace.

A: I am ok as long as it just affects our emotions; and the emotions indirectly affect our actions. Praying to God does not heal. 
It gives us the mental courage to cope with the pain.

T: Why is that not necessary according to you?

A: Because, I can invoke the same courage without believing in the existance of a god. I do not need to equate god as a 
meta-emotion. God CAN be a meta-emotion; a subset of meta-emotions just like sense altering drugs; but it is not the only way. I am 
ok people deriving strength by believing in God. But I am not ok if they say that the Voyager is still continuing in space due to 
god's grace.

T: Well, there has been multiple possibilities when the space craft could have failed. Say it surviving means True (T). Thus it's 
current state is TTTT....n times.... Now, that is a 1 in $2^n$ chance, which is rare. A single False would make it fail.

A: It brings us to the argument of noogenesis. Why are there no aliens; intelligent by design; creationism. Yes, having existence 
from spontaneous quantum fluctions is an extremenly rare event. But, it is not so rare when put in the perspective of the time 
scale of the universe. Rather it is the contrary; by Fermi's paradox.

T: So either way, i.e. either only it is us who is created. Why does that not make you feel special? In the infinite complexity of 
the universe, is imagining an intelligence God like entity capable of creating us so difficult.

A: Aliens creating us and placing us precisely on Earth, listening silently to our prayers and beings vastly more powerful and 
potent is far easy to imagine logically to me - like Daniken's arguments. But something predating or encompassing the Universe is 
not.

T: What? If you can have the entropy required for intelligence, the same entropy would have existed in the early universe. The 
entire universe is atleast as intelligence as all intelligence of Earth put together.

A: Well, that still leaves the possibility that all the intelligence of the early universe got concentrated on Earth. But there is 
a catch. Intelligence is emergent. Earth did not have intelligent lifeforms in its initial days.

T: Was it embedded somewhere in the chaos?

A: Unlikely. QM allows spontaneous existence of things. There were no uranium or NaCl (needed for neural signals in thought) in the 
early universe. Deterministic intelligent designs getting conserved over nuclear fission is unlikely.

T: So what is intelligence. Because animals dont believe in gods! Looks like god is the result of complex thought.

A: Agree. Meta-emotion. The notion to understand the physical world gives rise to calculus or gods. It is like the renormalization 
factor to things we cannot explain so that everything sums up.

T: But that again brings us to what is real. Calculus is real. God is not according to you. How do you make the distinction. Both 
calculus and god solves problems humanity faces. Both are agreed upon by multiple factions.

A: Calculus is not real. It is a tool to make our lives easy; an approximation that helps us to calculate impossible things. Just 
like god.

T: Why shouldnt both be allowed to exist?

A: No problem in god existing. I am just suggesting an alternate method of solving the problem. In which one doesn't believe in a 
deus ex.

T: So does god exist?

A: I submit, the problem of god existing is not provable; just like the existance of infinity. No one has seen or experience infinity. It is not necessary, at the same time; knowing its capability and limitation is. Since it is not provable, discussing its real existance is beyond my scope.
