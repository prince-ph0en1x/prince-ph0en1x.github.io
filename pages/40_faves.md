Every object is influenced by its environment. If you know me and not know how I interact with my surrounding - it is just half my story. Knowing my environment is as simple as knowing my biases. And why do biases exist? That is the compressed embedding of multitudes of experiences in the past. It is really like those neural network weights, which can no longer explain the contribution of each training data in tuning a particular weight to the value it is. This section is perhaps the easiest for me to pen down (or rather type out), yet, quite probably, just going through these list can give the readers quite a clear sketch of my character.

Here I list out my favourite [artists/artwork](/faves/art/), [musicians/songs](/faves/music/), [books](/faves/books/), [actors/movies](/faves/movies/), [quotes](/faves/quotes/), [games](/faves/games/) and [food](/faves/food/).
