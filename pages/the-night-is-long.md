### Blackboard

Cometh knowledge onto thee,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cometh knowledge, to you, through me.  
The dust, the cloud, the light, the lines,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letters scribbled on -  
An intelligent face, among all dreamy gaze,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mirror to all, am I.  

The King of the class, the pride, the lust -  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield where wars are fought,  
Me the hero, in the Trojan scenario,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the giant book of historic thoughts.  

Projectors and whiteboards, new in the trade,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart may be they, than me,  
Think 'wice err you speak, as they are -  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet far less efficient.  
Find me Oxbridge, to the remotest hamlet,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slate my grandson be.  

Professors and artists, lessons and activities,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow all to you, through me.  
I am the board, black inside out,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bearer of all these fame.

### Muse of the blank canvas

A painting there...  
hung alone, blank.  
To it yet, colours  
wait, till a touch...  
for life to bloom.  
The story it told,  
as I gazed, amazed...  
Muse she was past,  
her dreamy stare,  
in touch of brush,  
it was decorated...  
The canvas as now,  
future - a thought,  
hung alone, blank...  

### The Secret

The scent of old paper - the thoughts, in his mind;  
The ink-pot - the mahogany table, he writes on;  
The open window - the cold breeze, blowing by;  
The overcast sky - the cloudy mood, my Lord all alone...  

It was then he took me up,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held me hand by hand.  
A refreshing bath, in the near blue tub,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My spirits refilled up again.  
The paper I toughed, and his thoughts flowed,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, his humble servant.  
The silent prayer, the golden emote,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three little words, scribbled then.  
And at the end, not all is the same,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the name was stamped on.  
Whisper I shouldn't, for it's a secret,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between me and my Lord...  

The scent of old paper - the thoughts, in his mind;  
The ink-pot - the mahogany table, he writes on;  
The open window - the cold breeze, blowing by;  
The overcast sky - the cloudy mood, and the letter of my Lord...
