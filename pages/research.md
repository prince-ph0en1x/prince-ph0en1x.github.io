## Unification vs Occam's Razor

When you are into the topic of emergence, you can't help but wonder about the phase transitions where different laws take over at different scales. Quoting Douglas R. Hofstadter (from the book I am a strange loop), "thinkodynamics is explained by statistical mentalics", sometimes knowing everything about individual components of a system (e.g. neuron) tell us very little of how the components behave as a whole (e.g. consciousness). It is not sorcery that the usual scientific method of reductionism does not work here. It is simply that many laws of the overall system is embedded in the interaction behaviour of the components, rather than the components themselves. In physics, we call this coupling. In quantum computing, perhaps, a similar notion is of entanglement. Following the ideas of Juan M. Maldacena (in his ER = EPR paper with Leonard Susskind), in classical mechanics, they are wormholes.

A question that perhaps keeps popping up is, are gravity (general relativity) and quantum mechanics one and the same - two different ways (even mutually conflicting at times) of interpreting the same thing? They work extremely well in their own niche scale - GR for galactic scales, QM for atomic scales. The obviously problems arise when there is both, mass concentrated in small space, as in the early Universe or blackholes. One way of approaching this problem is called the Holographic Principle, where two very different interpretations, a bulk theory in n-dimensions and a boundary theory in (n-1)-dimensions, describe a single reality.

However, grand unified theory (GUT) and consciousness are not the only places where scientists have trouble going from 2 views of reality to 1. It is very much a problem within the [basic postulates][1] of quantum mechanics itself; where normally a closed system evolves unitarily (which is invertible, deterministic and continuous), while any interaction with an observer (nothing to do with consciousness), results in a measurement (which in irreversible, probabilistic and instantaneous).

What is more interesting for me is however, this this duality true for computability and complexity as well? For complexity, Shannon and Kolmogorov metrics converge asymptotically for true randomness. For computability, what is the difference between the state machine and the tape in the Turing Machine. For languages, what is the difference between syntax and semantics?

## The Grand (Un-)unified Theory

While theoretical physicists are lamenting over the differences and compatibility of two of the most fundamental physical laws, a more birds eye view of the landscape of the universal design reveals some very important structures, that are so deeply embedded around us, we need to ask, why?
Here I ponder over some of those structures that I find particularly interesting.
