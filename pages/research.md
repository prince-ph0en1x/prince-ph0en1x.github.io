## Current research interests

* Algorithmic Complexity
* Learning Theory, Artificial General Intelligence, Recursive Self Improvement
* Quantum Information and Computation
* Emergent Properties of a System

## On the shoulder of giants

I have been deeply inspired by many 'giants' in the scientific community. I hold them in the highest regard for either their thoughts well resonated with mine or their propositions fuels my neural engines to do research.
* Alan Turing - Turing machine, Turing test
* John von Neumann - Self-replicating machines; automata theory; stored program
* Kurt Gödel - Incompleteness theorem
* Andrey Kolmogorov - Algorithmic complexity
* Gregory Chaitin - Algorithmic complexity,omega number
* Stephen Wolfram - Cellular automata types
* Benoit Mandelbrot - Fractals
* Roger Penrose - Quantum mind, Penrose tilings
* Albert Einstein - General relativity
* John Archbald Wheeler - It from bit
* Max Plank - Plank units
* Jurgen Schmidhuber - Low complexity art, Gödel machines
* Werner Heisenberg - Uncertainty principle
* Claude Shannon - Information theory
* Richard Feynman - Quantum computation, Feynman diagrams
* Alonso Church - Lambda calculus
* Erwin Schrödinger - Schrödinger equation, Schrödinger cat, quantum biology
* De Bröglie - Wave-particle duality
* Marvin Minsky - Artificial intelligence
* Neils Bohr - Atomic model
* Erwin Schrodinger - Wavefunction
* Leonard Susskind - String theory, loop quantum gravity
* Ken Thompson - Regular expressions, Unix, B
* James Maxwell - Maxwell's demon
* Edward Witten - M-Theory
* Stephen Hawkins - Hawkings radiation
... the list keeps growing as the horizon of my knowledge widens.

## The Grand (Un-)unified Theory

While theoretical physicists are lamenting over the differences and compatibility of two of the most fundamental physical laws, a more birds eye view of the landscape of the universal design reveals some very important structures, that are so deeply embedded around us, we need to ask, why?
Here I ponder over some of those structures that I find particularly interesting.
* Godel's Incompleteness Theorems
* Kolmogorov Complexity
* Quines
* Fractals
* Chaos
* Shannon Entropy
* Holographic Universe
* Quantum Entanglement
* Golden Mean
* Neural Network
* DNA
* Thermodynamics
* Standard Model
* Brainwaves
* Plank Units
* Cellular Automata
* Church-Turing Thesis
