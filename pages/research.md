### Research interests

My research interests evolve over time. Some of the current core themes are:
* Emergence - phase changes in computational complexity, gravity from quantum entanglement
* Algorithmic Complexity - universality, expressibility, fractals, tensor networks
* Artificial General Intelligence - recursive self-improvement, artificial life, explainable neural networks
* Quantum Computation - quantum Hamiltonian complexity, quantum optimization, quantum learning theory
* Soft-computing - hardness of approximate, neuro-evolution

#### Current Projects
* Near-term quantum optimization and learning algorithm for genomics (Ph.D. dissertation)
* Evolutionary quines on gene expressions for recursive self-improvement systems
* Spiking neural network based associative memory evolution for context-based navigation

... if you are interest for a master's thesis in QCA lab on related topics, feel free to contact me.

#### Past Projects
* Quantum algorithms for pattern-matching in genomic sequences (M.Sc. thesis)
* Quantum Innovation Environment (QuInE), a PyQT based IDE for quantum programming
* Brain-inspired robotic mapping and navigation using time-series of hexagonal grid and place cells
* System design of warehouse automation using multi-agent collaborative box-pushing strategies
* Human brain simulation in GPU with Inferior Olive model in OpenCL and CUDA
* GATK based human genome sequencing for distributed Spark platform in Scala
* Fuzzing and concolic execution on RERS-2016 problems using AFL and KLEE
* Optimizing a SoC using œÅ-VEX VLIW processors
* Enhancing the Plasma processor IP core
* Accelerating object tracking in OMAP3530 application processor
* Solar energy forecasting using ORCA system
* Earthquake occurrence analysis and aftershock prediction using MATLAB and Tableau
* Elevation mapping using stereo vision enabled heterogeneous multi-agent network (B.Tech. thesis)
* Computer vision based centralized multi-agent system on MATLAB and Arduino
* Self-configuring classical logic gate circuits using genetic programming in Java
* Multi-vehicle path planning in dynamically changing environments using genetic optimised TSP
