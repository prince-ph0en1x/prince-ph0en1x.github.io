### The Grand (Un-)unified Theory

While theoretical physicists are lamenting over the differences and compatibility of two of the most fundamental physical laws, a more birds eye view of the landscape of the universal design reveals some very important structures, that are so deeply embedded around us, we need to ask, why?
Here I ponder over some of those structures that I find particularly interesting.
* Godel's Incompleteness Theorems
* Kolmogorov Complexity
* Quines
* Fractals
* Chaos
* Shannon Entropy
* Holographic Universe
* Quantum Entanglement
* Golden Mean
* Neural Network
* DNA
* Thermodynamics
* Standard Model
* Brainwaves
* Plank Units
* Cellular Automata
* Church-Turing Thesis
