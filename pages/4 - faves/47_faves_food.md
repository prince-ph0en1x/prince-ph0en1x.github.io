## Cuisines

My favourite cuisine is [Mughlai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughlai_cuisine), the blend of Persian and North Indian cuisine during the Mughal rule. My native [Bengali cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_cuisine) comes a close second. I spent quite some years in South India and North Europe. There are very few dishes I enjoy from these places.

### Mughlai
