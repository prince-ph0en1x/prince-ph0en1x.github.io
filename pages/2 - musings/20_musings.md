# Quotes

A collection of those eureka moments when you find an allegory worth remembering – while reading a book, brooding in the shower, or deep philosophical conversations with friends.
* Be it described by, Low-complexity art or Occam's razor; Nature favors designs with high informational entropy with low Kolmogorov complexity... in short, God is a lazy programmer!
* "Sarcasm is a word in the lexicon"... is a self-referential statement. It is either false, or true but cannot be proven in the premise while preserving it sarcastic truth at the same instant! Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.
* All of learning theory is mostly "Classification + Correlation"... dividing data into sets and understanding the relations between them.
* Pressing UnDo does not take you into the past, it takes you to an alternate future. Pressing ReDo does not correct your mistake, it accounts for a misjudgment requiring two actions.
* When you are rolling some dice you can either accept that the results are truly random or you can believe that they are decided by God. But, if you choose the latter, you must understand that this God of yours must roll some virtual dice of his own in order to decide your dice rolling results.
* Probabilities do not exist. It is only useful for faking the future as present. Statistics is what is real. 
* If a string is compressed, it must include the decompressor compiler length as part of it.
* Randomness is not predictable, not patterned, not biased. Randomness is whatever is left over when we have listed all the known patterns in the universe. [ref][https://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2014/10/randomness-the-ghost-in-the-machine.html]
