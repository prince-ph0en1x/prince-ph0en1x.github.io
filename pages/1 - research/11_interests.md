### Really Big Questions <a name="questions"></a>

As John Archibald Wheeler would have it, these RBQs fuel my scientific quest. 
* *Why is the Universe computable?* - The extraordinary effectiveness of AIT techniques like Solomonoff induction and UAGI like AIXI is based on just one assumption: the Universe is computable by a universal Turing machine. Why so? Is this a self-evident and necessary axiom/assumption as formalizing such a question within language is related to computation. Why does the Church-Turing thesis hold? What does that tell us of the nature of our physical laws, or of the scientific method, or their limits thereof? Why do simple programs give rise to complex behavior? Is comprehension by compression and uncomputability of universal automata two sides of the same coin? Is everything relative to a partial trace or course-graining? Is truth relational? The ubiquity of universality and the computational reducibility self-referential? Does a Markov blanket automatically give rise to a probability distribution of Bayesian beliefs and information geometry? Is a non-anthropocentrism viewpoint possible?
* *Is there a computational action?* - The action in Lagrangian in physics is fundamental to many core theories and look very similar to computational and algorithmic complexity - Are they? What roles do the computational resources play? What is the relation between computational, algorithmic complexity and thermodynamics? Can locality and causality be violated?

#### A dozen favorite problems

Wheeler's illustrious student, Richard Feynman [suggested](https://fortelabs.com/blog/12-favorite-problems-how-to-spark-genius-with-the-power-of-open-questions/) to have a few favorite problems handy to brood on. Here are mine:
1. Is there any structure in the universe, or do structures reflect the incapabilities/symmetries of our laws/instruments? Can all symmetry of the universe be broken, or do the last few symmetries (e.g., CPT symmetry and Lorentz invariance) reflect the limitations of the math we use to do physics?
2. Why don't we see any super Turing processes in Nature, or is the quantum measurement collapse (or any conversion from continuous to discrete) a super Turing process?
3. Why Occam's razor works in general, especially in science.
4. How to define art? How do we formalize intrinsic motivation without turning it into a cost function?
5. How do we formalize the blurry spectrum of non-living/living and intelligent/dumb? Integrated information theory?
6. What is more foundational? Shannon entropy or Kolmogorov entropy? Circuit complexity or algorithmic complexity?
7. How bad are the approximate estimates of AIT metrics? How are these estimates so successful (e.g., compression or LLM program synthesis) if it's semi-computable?
8. What properties of quantum circuits make them difficult to simulate classically?
9. Can direct computer interfaces (e.g., Neuralink) enable different kinds of programming models without discrete languages, rather by more fluid thought?
10. Which ontological standing is more sound - the world is at its finest scale, continuous or discrete? Quantum-classical, or NumberTheory. If the world is discrete, we have to give an ontic explanation of the specific value of Plank's constant, or speed of light.
11. Can we do away with all fundamental constants of nature or explain why they have certain values?
12. Can there be any experimental evidence of consciousness/qualia as a post-hoc explanatory brain process?

### Mind Map <a name="mindmap"></a>
... of all things I love to keep myself updated about and the associated contributors to those ideas...

The blue boxes and their 1-hop neighbours are my core interests.

[![Mind map](/images/research/mindmap02.svg)](/images/research/mindmap02.svg)

I tried finding my core interests in the 'Domain of Science' charts. I eventually figured that most of my core interests lie in the field of [computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzJ46YA_RaA). The interests within physics, mathematics, and biology reflect the topics in computer science. Here's the result:
