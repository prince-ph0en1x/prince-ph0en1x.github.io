### Really Big Questions <a name="questions"></a>

As John Archibald Wheeler would have it, these RBQs fuel my scientific quest. 
* *Why is the Universe computable?* - The extraordinary effectiveness of AIT techniques like Solomonoff induction and UAGI like AIXI is based on just one assumption: the Universe is computable by a universal Turing machine. Why so? Is this a self-evident and necessary axiom/assumption as formalizing such a question within language is related to computation. Why does the Church-Turing thesis hold? What does that tell us of the nature of our physical laws, or of the scientific method, or their limits thereof? Why do simple programs give rise to complex behavior? Is comprehension by compression and uncomputability of universal automata two sides of the same coin? Is everything relative to a partial trace or course-graining? Is truth relational? The ubiquity of universality and the computational reducibility self-referential? Does a Markov blanket automatically give rise to a probability distribution of Bayesian beliefs and information geometry? Is a non-anthropocentrism viewpoint possible?
* *Is there a computational action?* - The action in Lagrangian in physics is fundamental to many core theories and look very similar to computational and algorithmic complexity - Are they? What roles do the computational resources play? What is the relation between computational, algorithmic complexity and thermodynamics? Can locality and causality be violated?

#### A dozen favorite problems

Wheeler's illustrious student, Richard Feynman [suggested](https://fortelabs.com/blog/12-favorite-problems-how-to-spark-genius-with-the-power-of-open-questions/) to have a few favorite problems handy to brood on. Here are mine:
1. Is there any structure in the universe, or do structures reflect the incapabilities/symmetries of our laws/instruments? Can all symmetry of the universe be broken, or do the last few symmetries (e.g., CPT symmetry and Lorentz invariance) reflect the limitations of the math we use to do physics?
2. Why don't we see any super Turing processes in Nature, or is the quantum measurement collapse (or any conversion from continuous to discrete) a super Turing process?
3. Why Occam's razor works in general, especially in science.
4. How to define art? How do we formalize intrinsic motivation without turning it into a cost function?
5. How do we formalize the blurry spectrum of non-living/living and intelligent/dumb? Integrated information theory?
6. What is more foundational? Shannon entropy or Kolmogorov entropy? Circuit complexity or algorithmic complexity?
7. How bad are the approximate estimates of AIT metrics? How are these estimates so successful (e.g., compression or LLM program synthesis) if it's semi-computable?
8. What properties of quantum circuits make them difficult to simulate classically?
9. Can direct computer interfaces (e.g., Neuralink) enable different kinds of programming models without discrete languages, rather by more fluid thought?
10. Which ontological standing is more sound - the world is at its finest scale, continuous or discrete? Quantum-classical, or NumberTheory. If the world is discrete, we have to give an ontic explanation of the specific value of Plank's constant, or speed of light.
11. Can we do away with all fundamental constants of nature or explain why they have certain values?
12. Can there be any experimental evidence of consciousness/qualia as a post-hoc explanatory brain process?

### My research journey and perspective <a name="perspective"></a>

My favorite perspective in high school was primary computer science (say, about 3/4 of my motivation), followed by physics and mathematics subjects. Computer science primarily included Boolean algebra, computer organization, and object-oriented programming, while some of my most interesting physics topics included wave-particle duality, transistors, and thermodynamics. The few topics I liked in mathematics were permutation combinations and probability.

During my bachelor's, I was officially enrolled in avionics (aviation electronics), which aligns more with electronics engineering (among popular B.Tech streams in India). My curriculum and projects allowed me to develop additional insights into microcontrollers, robotics, computer vision, and swarm intelligence, besides honing my interest in programming and computer architecture. Some introductory courses also introduced me to modern physics, relativity, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics. Various online/guest courses introduced me to the fascinating topics of genetic programming, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and quantum computation. What's also essential here are the topics I did not appreciate or that were not part of my curriculum. The former included signal processing, control systems, and functional analysis, while the latter (i.e., topics I wished I got an opportunity to learn) included automata theory and learning theory.

While in ISRO, I honed my low-level assembly programming and VHDL-based FPGA programming skills. It also allowed me to appreciate system-level design and fault-analysis. This gave me a complete hands-on from high-level logic to timed electrical signals that execute the logic - a perspective that became indispensable later in my quantum computing efforts.

My master's was embedded within the computer engineering department of TU Delft, which included topics from electrical engineering, embedded systems, and computer science. At the same time, my specialization in quantum computation introduced topics like quantum information, quantum communication, and quantum computer architecture. This allowed me to transport my classical full-stack perspective to quantum computation while my interest in programming induced my thesis work on quantum algorithms. It was specifically also motivated by the genetic programming perspective of code describing a physical system encoded as genes, which roughly translated to the application for which I developed the quantum algorithms.

With this perspective, I started my doctoral research. In the second year, I found out about algorithmic information theory. The synergy of AIT and QC has become my most loved perspective since then. Looking back, with a full circle of destiny, it merged all of my perspectives from school. QC allows states much richer for exotic computation, while AIT is the gatekeeper of algorithms, resources, and explainability. Both have implications for AI, a perspective that was increasingly hard to decouple. With QC, I could explore QML and automation in quantum computation (algorithm design, compilation, control, etc.), while with AIT, I could explore universal reinforcement learning, AGI, and the thermodynamics of computation. 

I would be best described as a 'quantum computer architect.'

I am the CS and QM guy in a CE dept.

### Mind Map <a name="mindmap"></a>
... of all things I love to keep myself updated about and the associated contributors to those ideas...

The blue boxes and their 1-hop neighbours are my core interests.

[![Mind map](/images/research/mindmap02.svg)](/images/research/mindmap02.svg)

I tried finding my core interests in the 'Domain of Science' charts. I eventually figured that most of my core interests lie in the field of [computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzJ46YA_RaA). The interests within physics, mathematics, and biology reflect the topics in computer science. Here's the result:
