### Research Questions <a name="questions"></a>
I am primarily devoted in finding clues to: 
* *Why is the Universe computable?* - the extraordinary effectiveness of AIT techniques like Solomonoff induction is based on just one assumption: the Universe is computable by a universal Turing machine. Why so? Why do the Church-Turing thesis hold? What does that tell us of the nature of our physical laws, or of the scientific method? Why do simple programs give rise to complex behavior? Is comprehension by compression and uncomputability of universal automata two sides of the same coin? Is everything relative to a partial trace or course-graining? Is truth relational? The ubiquity of universality and the computational reducibility self-referential? Does a Markov blanket automatically give rise to a probability distribution of Bayesian beliefs and information geometry? Is a non-anthropocentrism viewpoint possible?
* *Is there a computational action?* - the action in Lagrangian in physics is fundamental to many core theories and look very similar to computational and algorithmic complexity - Are they? What roles do the computational resources play? What is the relation between computational, algorithmic complexity and thermodynamics? Can locality and causality be violated?

### Research Themes <a name="themes"></a>
Research themes evolve over time. My older interests are listed with ~~strikethrough~~. Some of my core interests are:
* *Artificial General Intelligence* - universal artificial intelligence; recursive self-improvement; universal constructors; ~~explainable neural networks~~; neuro-evolution; neuro-symbolic AI; ~~cellular automata rule learning~~; ~~algorithmic perturbation analysis~~; ~~do-calculus~~; experimental algorithmic information theory; ~~computational complexity phase change behavior~~; relations between expressibility-reachability-learnability-universality; description complexity ...[read more](https://aritrasarkar.com/research/agi/)
* *Quantum Computation* - ~~quantum Hamiltonian complexity~~; ~~quantum learning theory~~; quantum complexity geometry; quantum information; ~~quantum swarm intelligence~~; tensor networks; holographic quantum circuit complexity; ~~Feynman checkerboard QFT~~ ...[read more](https://aritrasarkar.com/research/quantum/)
* *Computational Applied Category Theory* - computational category theory; universal algebras; categorical intelligence
* *Bioinformatics* - in silico design space exploration for xenobiology; artificial life; synthetic biology; causal models of gene regulatory network; self-replicating RNA medicines
* *Swarm intelligence* - ~~multi-agent collaboration~~; ~~swarm robotics~~; emergence; coarse-graining
* Others - ~~fractals~~; ~~game theory~~; ~~RtOS~~; ~~computer vision~~; ~~digital steganography~~

Here's a visual that captures the most important topics:

### Mind Map <a name="mindmap"></a>
... of all things I live to keep myself updated about, and associated contributor to those ideas,...

The blue boxes and their 1-hop neighbours are my core interests.

[![Mind map](/images/research/mindmap02.svg)](/images/research/mindmap02.svg)

I tried finding my core interests in the Domain of Science charts. I eventually figured that most of my core interests lie in the field of [computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzJ46YA_RaA). The interests within physics, mathematics, and biology reflect the topics in computer science. Here's the result:
