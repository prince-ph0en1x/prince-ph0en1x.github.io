### Research

#### Research Questions
<pr></pr>
I am primarily devoted in finding clues to:
* *Why is the Universe computable?* - the extraordinary effectiveness of AIT techniques like Solomonoff induction is based on just one assumption: the Universe is computable by a universal Turing machine. Why so? Why do the Church-Turing thesis hold? What does that tell us of the nature of our physical laws, or of the scientific method? Why do simple programs give rise to complex behavior? Is comprehension by compression and uncomputability of universal automata two sides of the same coin? Is everything relative to a partial trace or course-graining? Is truth relational? The ubiquity of universality and the computational reducibility self-referential? Does a Markov blanket automatically give rise to a probability distribution of Bayesian beliefs and information geometry? Is a non-anthropocentrism viewpoint possible?
* *Is there a computational action?* - the action in Lagrangian in physics is fundamental to many core theories and look very similar to computational and algorithmic complexity - Are they? What roles do the computational resources play? What is the relation between computational, algorithmic complexity and thermodynamics? Can locality and causality be violated? 

#### Current Projects
* Quantum program synthesis using theorem provers and categorical logic
* Embedded participatory observers in causal sets within conformal fields
* Quantum accelerated causal inference for applications in explainable AI and bioinformatics

### Mind Map
... of all things I live to keep myself updated about, and associated contributor to those ideas,...

The blue boxes and their 1-hop neighbours are my core interests.

[![Mind map](/images/research/mindmap02.svg)](/images/research/mindmap02.svg)

I tried finding my core interests in the Domain of Science charts. I eventually figured that most of my core interests lie in the field of [computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzJ46YA_RaA). The interests within physics, mathematics, and biology reflect the topics in computer science. Here's the result:

### On the shoulder of giants

(Created Jul 23, 2019) (Updated Apr 10, 2022)

I have been deeply inspired by many *giants* in the scientific community. I hold them in the highest regard for either their thoughts well resonate with mine or their propositions fuel my neural engines. The 3 of my most favourite scientists: John von Neumann, John Archibald Wheeler, Ray Solomonoff, in Salvador Dali art style (using the Android app Moment Cam).
