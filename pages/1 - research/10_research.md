### Research Themes
My research interests evolve over time. Some of the current core themes are:
* *Emergence* - phase changes in computational complexity, gravity from quantum entanglement
* *Algorithmic Probability* - universality, description complexity, expressibility, fractals, tensor networks
* *Artificial General Intelligence* - recursive self-improvement, artificial life, universal constructors, explainable neural networks, neuro-evolution
* *Quantum Computation* - quantum Hamiltonian complexity, quantum learning theory, quantum complexity geometry

#### Current Projects
* Quantum-accelerated estimation of algorithmic information (Ph.D. dissertation)
* Near-term quantum optimization and learning algorithms
* Evolutionary quines on gene expressions for recursive self-improvement systems
* Spiking neural network based associative memory neuro-evolution

#### Mind Map
... of all things I live to keep myself updated about, and associated contributor to those ideas,...

The blue boxes and their 1-hop neighbours are my core interests.
