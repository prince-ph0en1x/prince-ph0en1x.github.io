# Quantum Quixote

There is already a [Quantum Pontiff][1], [Quantum Sheikh][2] and [Quantum Pundit][3]. Hey, I am a Hindu by birth and pundit is already taken! Also, I am so confused - am I an atheist or an agnostic. Duh! It is not about your real faith.... do I believe in a single way of doing computation, a single enterprise taking over, a single physical platform.... no! But also, when it comes to quantum, I am not an atheist like [Gil Kalai][4]. Rather the opposite. I like to dream big - even unrealistic, quixotic. And that has set me on a course through the stormy waters on my own adventure: The Ingenious Gentleman Sir Quan' Quixote of Delft.
