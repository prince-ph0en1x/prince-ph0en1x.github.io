### Blackboard

Cometh knowledge onto thee,
	Cometh knowledge, to you, through me.
The dust, the cloud, the light, the lines,
	The letters scribbled on -
An intelligent face, among all dreamy gaze,
	A mirror to all, am I.

The King of the class, the pride, the lust -
	The battlefield where wars are fought,
Me the hero, in the Trojan scenario,
	On the giant book of historic thoughts.

Projectors and whiteboards, new in the trade,
	Smart may be they, than me,
Think 'wice err you speak, as they are -
	Yet far less efficient.
Find me Oxbridge, to the remotest hamlet,
	A slate my grandson be.

Professors and artists, lessons and activities,
	Flow all to you, through me.
I am the board, black inside out,
	The bearer of all these fame.

### Muse of the blank canvas

A painting there...
hung alone, blank.
To it yet, colours
wait, till a touch...
for life to bloom.
The story it told,
as I gazed, amazed...
Muse she was past,
her dreamy stare,
in touch of brush,
it was decorated...
The canvas as now,
future - a thought,
hung alone, blank...
