### Quixote?

Yes, if there already is a Quantum Poitiff, Quantum Seikh and Quantum Pundit. But hey, I am a Hindu by birth, and pundit is already taken! Also, I am confused - am I an atheist or agnostic. Ah! Well, it is not about your real faith.... do I believe in a single way of doing computation, a single enterprise taking over, a single physical platform.... no! But also, when it comes to quantum, I am not an atheist like Gil Kadai. Rather the opposite. I like to dream big - even unrealistic, quixotic. And that sets me on a course through the stormy waters on my own adventure: The Ingenious Gentleman Sir Quan' Quixote of Delft.
