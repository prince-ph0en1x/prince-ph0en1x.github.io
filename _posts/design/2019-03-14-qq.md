The Indian word to welcome is *Namaste*, meaning *"I bow to the divine in you"*.

In the contemporary era, though it has been translated literally to "bowing to you", it also has a spiritual import reflecting the belief that *"the divine and self (atman, soul) is same in you and me"* and thus ["the sacred in me recognizes the sacred in you"][1].

This website has long been lingering on my To-Do list. It is finally time to tick it off and having my own space to organise my thoughts.
