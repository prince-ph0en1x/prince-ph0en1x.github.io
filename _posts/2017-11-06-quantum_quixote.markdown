### Quixote?

There is already a [Quantum Pontiff](http://dabacon.org/pontiff/), [Quantum Sheikh](https://www.quantumsheikh.com/) and [Quantum Pundit](http://quantumpundit.blogspot.com/). Hey, I am a Hindu by birth and pundit is already taken! Also, I am so confused - am I an atheist or an agnostic. Duh! It is not about your real faith.... do I believe in a single way of doing computation, a single enterprise taking over, a single physical platform.... no! But also, when it comes to quantum, I am not an atheist like [Gil Kalai](https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/). Rather the opposite. I like to dream big - even unrealistic, quixotic. And that has set me on a course through the stormy waters on my own adventure: The Ingenious Gentleman Sir Quan' Quixote of Delft.

### There and back again

My little book of adventures:

* The observer principle
* Do we always need two laws?
